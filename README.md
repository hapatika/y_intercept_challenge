Points to note : 

1. I used Google Colab for the challenge, hence the drive mount and Colab-speciifc imports at the start. Please ignore the data comprehension part, it is simply some preliminary analysis.
2. In task 2, I evaluated the daily returns at close instead of at open, however the situations are symmetric.
3. Some references I used:
